## Part 2: Domain Research & Authorship
For your assigned domain, write 2 paragraphs describing:  
1. A real-world software development scenario that fits this domain  
2. Why this scenario belongs in this domain (not another)

### Clear
**Original**

**Paragraph 1 – Scenario**  
A clear example of a software development task in the Clear domain is setting up a standard Git workflow for a small development team. The steps are well known: creating a repository, defining a main branch, using feature branches, committing code regularly, and pushing changes to a shared remote repository. These steps are commonly taught in software programs and are widely used across the industry. There is very little uncertainty involved, and developers can follow documented guidelines to complete the task correctly.

**Paragraph 2 – Why it fits Clear**  
This scenario belongs in the Clear domain because the cause-and-effect relationship is obvious. If the correct Git steps are followed, the workflow works as expected. Best practices already exist, and there is no need for deep analysis or experimentation. Unlike complicated or complex problems, this task does not require expert judgment or discovery. It also is not chaotic, since there is no urgency or crisis involved. The correct response is simply to sense the situation, categorize it as a known problem, and apply established best practices.

**AI‑refined**

**Paragraph 1 – Scenario (refined)**  
A strong example of a Clear-domain software development task is implementing a standard Git workflow for a team project. This includes initializing a repository, creating a main branch, using feature branches for development, committing changes with clear messages, and pushing updates to a shared repository. These steps are clearly defined, well-documented, and consistently used in both academic and professional environments. Developers do not need to make assumptions or experiment, as the process is already proven and repeatable.

**Paragraph 2 – Why it fits Clear (refined)**  
This scenario fits the Clear domain because the relationship between actions and outcomes is direct and predictable. When established Git best practices are followed, the result is a clean and functional version control system. There is no ambiguity that would require expert analysis, experimentation, or immediate crisis response. Unlike complicated or complex domains, there are no unknowns to resolve. The appropriate approach is to sense the situation, categorize it as clear, and respond by applying existing best practices.

### Complicated
**Original**

**Paragraph 1 – Scenario**  
A complicated example in relation to software development is setting up Role-based access control (RBAC). The set up includes an admin assigning individual users to one or more roles. In this process, different roles represent different permissions for each user. This process is important because it determines user access rights, simplifying tasks like updating job functions, transforming business operations, and helping employee organizations. Additionally, the policies are a big help on cybersecurity vulnerabilities by enforcing the least privilege principle; this means, users have the minimum level of access to fulfill a job.

**Paragraph 2 – Why It Fits**  
This scenario belongs in the complicated domain because there can be difficulty managing highly granular permissions. There can be the accumulation of unnecessary permissions causing more vulnerabilities. This is called role explosion and permission creeps and it happens in large organizations where too many roles become more inconvenient. Moreover, there are four separate models for implementing RBAC making it very perplexing.

**AI‑refined**

**Paragraph 1 – Scenario (refined)**  
A complicated example in software development is implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This setup involves an administrator assigning individual users to one or more roles, where each role defines a specific set of permissions. RBAC is important because it determines user access rights and simplifies tasks such as updating job functions and managing changes in business operations. Additionally, RBAC policies improve cybersecurity by enforcing the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their roles.

**Paragraph 2 – Why It Fits (refined)**  
This scenario belongs in the complicated domain because managing highly granular permissions can be difficult and requires expert analysis. Over time, unnecessary permissions may accumulate, increasing security vulnerabilities—a problem known as role explosion and permission creep. This commonly occurs in large organizations where the growing number of roles becomes difficult to manage and maintain. Additionally, the existence of multiple RBAC implementation models adds further complexity, requiring careful evaluation to determine the most appropriate approach.

### Complex
**Original**

**Paragraph 1 – Scenario**  
The team is releasing a new feature that recommends study paths based on how students click, search, and complete tasks. Because this is a new market with different study habits, they start with a small pilot group, monitor usage, and adjust the recommendations after each release. They also gather interviews and support tickets to understand why students accept or ignore suggestions.

**Paragraph 2 – Why it fits Complex**  
This fits the Complex domain because cause and effect are not clear in advance and only become visible after observing real behavior. No amount of upfront analysis can predict how diverse learners will respond, so the team must run safe‑to‑fail experiments, sense patterns, and adapt. It is not merely complicated, because there is no single correct expert solution, and it is not chaotic because the team can still take measured steps rather than crisis response.

**AI‑refined**

**Paragraph 1 – Scenario (refined)**  
The team launches a study‑path recommendation feature that adapts to student clicks, search terms, and time‑on‑task. Since it is entering a new market with unfamiliar learning habits, they roll out to a small cohort, run A/B tests, and use analytics plus interviews to refine the recommendation logic over several iterations.

**Paragraph 2 – Why it fits Complex (refined)**  
This belongs in the Complex domain because outcomes emerge from interactions among students, content, and incentives that cannot be reliably predicted upfront. The appropriate response is to probe with safe‑to‑fail experiments, sense the results, and respond by evolving the feature as patterns become visible. Unlike the complicated domain, there is no single best practice to apply; unlike the chaotic domain, the team can still learn and stabilize through iterative feedback.

### Chaotic

## Visual Component
As a team, create a hand-drawn diagram inspired by the Wikipedia Cynefin image:

Reference: See the Cynefin Framework diagram on Wikipedia (also available in SimulCorp resources) Cynefin Framework by Edwin Stoop.

Your version should:
- Use the same quadrant structure
- Replace examples with software development scenarios relevant to your diploma program
- Include your team’s scenarios in each quadrant
- Be hand-drawn (not digital) — scan or photograph for submission

Using AI to Refine:
- Write your initial paragraphs in your own words
- Use an AI assistant to refine clarity and completeness
- Include both original AND AI‑refined versions

Deliverable (per domain owner):
- 2 paragraphs describing a software development scenario
- Original + AI‑refined versions
- Contribution to the team’s hand‑drawn diagram

## Part 3: Team Reflection
Reflect on the process of working together:
- How did the collaboration structure work for your team?
- What was it like for the Chaotic owner to have everyone’s input?
- What was it like for the Clear owner to work alone?
- What did you learn about your teammates through this exercise?

Deliverable: Team reflection (250–400 words)
